# Leader Election Algorithm

This package is an implementation of a decentralised leader election algorithm (flood max algorithm) in ROS. Since ROS doesn't officially support decentralised multi robot systems yet, it was necessary to first simulate such an environment before the algorithm could be applied. Multiple instances of a node are created through launch file and communication between them are allowed only based on the rules defined in a pre-assigned graph (strictly connected graph). Each instance (robot) sends feedback of what is happening from it's point of view in separate terminal, and once a leader is elected, he anounces himself as the "leader" of the gang and the same message is passed on to other members through the graph. Other members then update their status to "member" or in other words, not a leader. 

The code is written so that you can change the graph through the launch file easily and that you can run the simulation with any number of robots depending on how many are spawnned in the launch file. In the current form, there are six robots in the simulation and leader is elected based on the one with highest UserID. However, One can configure the program to choose any other heuristic instead of userid (say, min inter robot distances).
